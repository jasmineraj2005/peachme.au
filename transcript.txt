[00:00.92 - 00:03.06]  It's your first day home after surgery.
[00:03.54 - 00:04.88]  The hospital bed is gone.
[00:05.40 - 00:07.10]  The nurses aren't checking on you.
[00:07.60 - 00:09.34]  And suddenly, you're all alone.
[00:10.18 - 00:15.04]  You try to reach the desired summary, but it's filled with medical jaggren that feels
[00:15.04 - 00:19.06]  impossible to understand, leaving you more confused than ever.
[00:19.76 - 00:22.08]  You Google up your symptoms, hoping for answers.
[00:22.66 - 00:25.08]  For every search, it gives you conflicting advice.
[00:25.80 - 00:28.32]  Some say it's fine, while others say it's an emergency.
[00:29.32 - 00:32.88]  At last, you're left alone without any guidance or direction.
[00:33.82 - 00:35.28]  But does it have to be this way?
[00:38.36 - 00:40.12]  This is where Nier comes in.
[00:40.62 - 00:44.62]  Nier is a smart post-ditcher's case assistant that
[00:44.62 - 00:49.32]  helps patients monitor their recovery progress after leaving the hospital.
[00:50.00 - 00:56.48]  Nier is not another flashy AI tool, but a simple and reliable way to help patients recover
[00:56.48 - 00:59.10]  safely and feel confident at home.
[00:59.96 - 01:02.48]  This is the prep demo of how Nier worked.
[01:03.40 - 01:09.28]  She engaged with patients from day one of their recovery journey through any messaging platform.
[01:09.78 - 01:14.84]  By detecting and correcting input error, she ensures mood communication.
[01:15.64 - 01:21.12]  Nier also supports multiple languages, making it accessible to diverse ethnicity.
[01:22.12 - 01:29.94]  Every interaction is securely stored in enabling both doctors and patients to track their recovery progress.
[01:30.44 - 01:37.12]  A predictive model analyzing hospital data using regression to calculate the probability
[01:37.12 - 01:39.08]  of patient with admission.
[01:40.24 - 01:46.86]  Nier is an API service that is integrated directly into hospitals IT systems, keeping all
[01:46.86 - 01:49.00]  patient data, private and secure.
[01:49.64 - 01:56.02]  Implementation is completely free, with no setup course or extra work for the hospital staff.
[01:56.74 - 02:01.90]  And to make our offer even more irresistible, we only charge per successful outcome,
[02:02.28 - 02:07.60]  which means that hospitals only pay us when the patient recovers without being re-emitted.
[02:08.22 - 02:14.32]  It's a no-risk solution that improves patient care while reducing unnecessary hospital re-emissions.
[02:15.88 - 02:20.98]  Studies show that one in 10 patients face its preventable post-ditchard communication
[02:20.98 - 02:24.64]  causing Australian hospital 1.5 billion annually.
[02:25.74 - 02:31.54]  Our plan with Nier is to start with a major private hospital and a low-risk procedure
[02:31.54 - 02:33.44]  like lapestropic appendix to me.
[02:34.12 - 02:38.70]  One validated, we use our partner to expand into more complicated cases.
[02:38.92 - 02:43.66]  Furthermore, we scale across Victoria, the nationwide, making recover faster,
[02:43.66 - 02:45.00]  smarter and stress-free.
[02:46.00 - 02:50.72]  Together, we can make recovery for post-discharge patients safer and stress-free.
[02:51.24 - 02:53.60]  But the question is, will you be a part of it?
