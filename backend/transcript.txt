[00:00.00 - 00:03.86]  Hi, my name is Ethan. Thanks for accepting my resume.
[00:04.60 - 00:05.88]  So, prepared about myself.
[00:06.70 - 00:13.92]  I'm originally from Malaysia, but I've lived in Australia for like the past 8, 9, 10 years.
[00:15.58 - 00:17.54]  Recently moved to Melbourne for uni.
[00:18.32 - 00:21.52]  I came in for the July intake to uni-mail.
[00:22.54 - 00:27.58]  Currently I'm a commerce student, Bachelor of Commerce studying marketing at major.
[00:28.14 - 00:34.20]  Although one of my main interests is programming, which I got into about a couple months ago.
[00:35.16 - 00:39.02]  So, I'm doing like FOC foundations of computing as my breath,
[00:39.70 - 00:44.90]  learning the basics of Python, volume, volume, and all that.
[00:45.48 - 00:53.88]  I spend a lot of my free time actually learning programming, just self-coating my own projects,
[00:53.88 - 00:58.20]  trying to really just be able to build my own stuff.
[00:58.42 - 01:02.00]  That's kind of my goal, I guess, to be able to create stuff.
[01:03.04 - 01:12.20]  And yeah, I spend a lot of my time sleeping in a gym, studying, working on my own little site projects.
[01:14.70 - 01:19.52]  So, my understanding of the hard-earned advisory board is that you guys are,
[01:20.06 - 01:24.90]  you know, you guys are getting a bunch of students from different universities around Australia
[01:24.90 - 01:29.16]  to form a group where you can ask for feedback quickly.
[01:29.86 - 01:35.48]  I honest feedback and get it quickly so that you can shorten that feedback cycle.
[01:36.20 - 01:39.74]  So, you can ask for feedback, make a change, ask for feedback, make a change.
[01:40.38 - 01:45.36]  And the main reason why I would want to join is that I'm pretty interested in
[01:46.10 - 01:48.74]  studying my own startup sometime in the near future.
[01:49.16 - 01:53.54]  So, I mean, personally, what I really want to get out of this is
[01:54.08 - 01:59.52]  to be able to sort of absorb from you guys and learn from you guys, see what you guys are doing,
[01:59.74 - 02:05.40]  see how I can learn from that, implement that myself, and also help you guys, you know, in that
[02:05.40 - 02:15.34]  strange. So, where I believe I can add value is that I'm a pretty honest and straightforward person.
[02:16.00 - 02:21.52]  So, you know, it's something, if something is shit, I'll tell you that shit, but I'll make
[02:21.52 - 02:28.12]  sure to give you like my reasoning for it, my reasoning for why I think it's bad and how it could
[02:28.12 - 02:33.68]  be improved. So, I won't just, you know, say it's bad, I'll say it's bad. I think that it's bad
[02:33.68 - 02:38.74]  because of this and maybe you could try doing this to improve it. I'm also a knight also,
[02:39.00 - 02:46.54]  I'm awake till like 2, 3 AM, so, you know, you can always just send me a message, 1 AM, and I'll
[02:47.20 - 02:59.22]  get back to you really quick. So, yep, that's that. And the last question, if I could change one
[02:59.22 - 03:06.12]  thing about Hado, so I'm not really sure what I would change. One thing will be being more active
[03:06.12 - 03:11.68]  with like Instagram, China. I mean, I would be a lot more active on social media trying to build
[03:11.68 - 03:18.50]  brand awareness so that even before you close a uni, you know, like the students from the uni are
[03:19.04 - 03:25.86]  already kind of familiar with Hado, even before like officially integrating Hado into the LMS.
[03:25.86 - 03:31.92]  So that way it's just like last friction and you can, you know, use the students as support to
[03:33.16 - 03:42.42]  convince the uni to buy Hado. Another thing is, so like two months ago, Davein was actually really
[03:42.42 - 03:47.86]  nice, you know, he gave me some of his time and we had a chat in the cafe so that was really
[03:47.86 - 03:53.14]  nice of him. And yeah, I was really impressed with our conversation. He was answering like,
[03:53.14 - 04:01.82]  all my questions, he really knew a lot of stuff. So if you're watching this, thanks. But one thing
[04:01.82 - 04:07.46]  he mentioned was being like, put up orientated, focusing on the product and that's like the priority.
[04:08.14 - 04:13.00]  And I actually agree with that, but recently I've just been like thinking about it,
[04:13.76 - 04:20.26]  like how money, you know, like money is a way of transferring value, right? So the best way to
[04:20.26 - 04:31.62]  validate a product, if someone gives you their money for it. And like money is a representation of value,
[04:32.30 - 04:37.52]  and if the money you can use that to reinvest back into the product and, you know, improve the
[04:37.52 - 04:41.58]  product, you make a good product, you get money, you use the money to make the product better,
[04:42.16 - 04:49.26]  you scale up to more uni, you help more students and yeah, so I don't know if this is related,
[04:49.26 - 04:55.30]  but I guess taking that into consideration, like the business aspect of it and how,
[04:56.40 - 05:00.90]  yeah, okay, there's no enough time. Yeah, thanks. See you.
